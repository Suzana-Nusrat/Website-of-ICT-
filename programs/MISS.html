<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>The department has the following program objectives: a. To identify sources of risk for the loss of enterprise information and to develop methods of minimizing the identified risks based on the priorities established by senior management and the financial resources available to mitigate these risks. b. To understand the role of information systems security in relation to the other business processes in an enterprise. c. To develop a plan for the enterprise to recover from disasters where information ceases to be available to users. They will also have the skills to test the plan and to ensure that the plan is ready to be implemented when needed. d. To investigate information systems security incidents and develop and implement solutions to recover or minimize the loss of information. e. To securely install operating system software and to use this software to build login servers and application servers which are highly resistant to penetration by unauthorized users (both internal and external). f. To securely install servers on different operating environments. g. To develop an appropriate information security framework for an enterprise, including plans and policies which reflect recognized standards for implementing security policy (based on identifying stakeholders, security teams and infrastructure, data resource owners, and auditing used to ensure compliance). h. To determine legal issues involved in information systems security policy and architecture, and to know when to seek advanced legal help and/or help from law enforcement authorities. i. To manage projects involving cryptographic architectures for security and to implement a variety of solutions involving cryptography. j. To develop strategies for all methods of access control to an organization’s information systems and media containing organizational information (physical methods and network methods). k. To ensure that an organization meets the appropriate federal or provincial privacy legislation.</p>
<h1> Mission</h1>
<p>The mission of Masters in Information Systems Security (MISS) program is to prepare information assurance and cyber security specialists to get involved between industries and oversee the protection of information by implementing security measures on networks and computers. A recent survey by ISACA concluded that 46 percent of the security professionals surveyed indicated a technical skills gap as a major concern. Taking random classes without a clear plan is a terrible idea. If you understand the organization's risk profile then a professional master’s degree would allow you to develop the missing skills within the context of your organizational needs.</p>
<h1> Vision</h1>
<p> Department of ICT in the BUP seeks to avant-grade at the post graduate levels among public universities security to be a world-class center of excellence in skills, knowledge, cutting-edge technologies, expertise. The program covet to put the emphasis on helping each individual to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to maximize his or her potential as a researcher in information systems security. Students will be engaged in research and academic course examining existing theory and ways in which these influence the security of information systems.</p>
